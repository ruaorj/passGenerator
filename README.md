 # Hi! 
 This is a Password Generator. In fact, it **generates passwords that are difficult to crack**.
 You can use this **as a strong password suggestion for your login pages**.  
 Here's how: <b class="text-danger">Strong password:</b><span class="text-light bg-black" id="OutputRew"></span>        
 Or you can shape the code and use it in **various wordlists**.
 That's it from me **for now**, see you in other applications.
